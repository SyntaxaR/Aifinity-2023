## About the project

In this AI era, people have been discovering more and more potential of AI as an assistant to our daily lives and work. Following this trend, our team (STEMazon) developed Model.ai an search-engine-like web application to generate relevant images without background based on user inputs as tags. Our team aim to eliminate the repetitive processes of extracting the subject of the picture from a noisy image. The task that constantly bother designers, artists, marketing employees and all those who have presentation as part of their work. Now with Model.ai, you can choose from 8 options automatically cleaned for you using U-Squared-Net-based models pretrained on large dataset.
